## Organization Best Practices

### 1. Establish a Folder Structure Early

Before you have hundreds of documents, decide on an organization system:

**Choose one primary method:**
- Project-based (recommended for freelancers/agencies)
- Content-type based (recommended for content creators)
- Time-based (recommended for regular content production)
- Client-based (recommended for service businesses)

**Stick with your chosen system consistently.**

### 2. Use Descriptive Names

**Good document names:**
- ✅ "Blog Post - SEO Best Practices - Draft 2"
- ✅ "Client Proposal - ABC Corp - 2025-01-15"
- ✅ "Python Function - Data Validation"

**Poor document names:**
- ❌ "Untitled Document 1"
- ❌ "New Document"
- ❌ "asdf"

### 3. Tag Consistently

Create a tagging system and document it:

```
Status Tags: draft, final, needs-review, published
Priority Tags: urgent, high, medium, low
Project Tags: project-[name]
Client Tags: client-[name]
Type Tags: blog, email, social, code, report
```

### 4. Regular Maintenance

Schedule regular cleanup:

**Weekly:**
- Review saved items
- Add tags to untagged content
- Delete unwanted drafts

**Monthly:**
- Archive old projects
- Update folder structure if needed
- Check storage usage
- Clean up trash folder

**Quarterly:**
- Review overall organization
- Update tagging system
- Archive completed projects
- Optimize storage

### 5. Use Search, Don't Over-Organize

Don't spend hours creating perfect folders. Use search and tags to find content quickly.

**Balance:**
- Basic folder structure for big categories
- Tags for detailed organization
- Search for quick access

### 6. Leverage Notebooks for Projects

For any significant project, create a notebook:
- Keeps everything in one place
- Easier to share entire project
- Better for collaboration
- Provides context for content

### 7. Utilize Sharing for Team Organization

**For teams:**
- Create shared folders for team content
- Use consistent naming across team
- Document organization guidelines
- Regular team sync on structure

### 8. Back Up Important Content

Download critical content regularly:
- Use bulk download for projects
- Export as PDF or DOCX
- Keep local backups of essential files
- Export before major changes

### 9. Monitor Storage Usage

Keep an eye on storage:
- Delete large unused files
- Compress images when possible
- Archive old projects
- Upgrade plan if consistently near limit

### 10. Document Your System

Create a simple guide for your organization:
```
My Organization System:

Folders:
- Top level = Clients
- Second level = Project type
- Third level = Content type

Tags:
- Status: draft, final, published
- Priority: urgent, high, normal
- Type: blog, email, social

Naming:
[Type] - [Topic] - [Date] - [Status]
Example: "Blog - SEO Tips - 2025-01-15 - Draft"
```
