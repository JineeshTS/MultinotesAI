## Token & Usage Questions

### What are tokens?

Tokens are units of measurement for AI processing. Think of them like credits:
- ~1 token = 4 characters or 0.75 words
- Both your prompt and AI's response consume tokens
- Different operations use different amounts

### How many tokens do I have?

Your token balance is always displayed in the top-right corner of your dashboard. Click it for a detailed breakdown.

### What's the difference between text tokens and file tokens?

- **Text Tokens:** Used for text generation, code, conversations
- **File Tokens:** Used for images, audio, video processing

File operations require more computational power, so they're tracked separately.

### How many words can I generate with my tokens?

**Rough estimates:**
- 1,000 tokens ≈ 750 words
- 50,000 tokens ≈ 37,500 words
- 150,000 tokens ≈ 112,500 words

Actual usage varies based on prompt length and response complexity.

### Why did I use more tokens than expected?

**Common reasons:**
- Both input (prompt) and output (response) use tokens
- Chatbot mode includes conversation history in each request
- Longer, more detailed prompts use more tokens
- Regenerating content uses tokens each time
- Some models are less token-efficient

### Do tokens expire?

Yes, tokens expire at the end of your subscription period (30 days for monthly plans). They do NOT roll over to the next month.

### Can I buy additional tokens without upgrading?

Not currently. To get more tokens, upgrade to a higher-tier plan.

### What happens when I run out of tokens?

AI generation stops working until:
- Your subscription renews (automatic token refill)
- You upgrade to a higher plan (immediate token addition)

Your existing content remains accessible.

### Do failed generations consume tokens?

No, you're only charged tokens for successful completions. If an error occurs, no tokens are deducted.

### How can I conserve tokens?

1. Be concise with prompts
2. Specify desired output length
3. Avoid unnecessary regeneration
4. Use the most efficient AI model for your task
5. Edit AI output instead of regenerating
6. Start fresh conversations instead of long chatbot threads

### Can I see how many tokens each generation used?

Yes! Click on any generation to see detailed token usage breakdown.

### Do I get refunded tokens if I don't like the output?

No, tokens are consumed upon generation regardless of satisfaction. Try editing your prompt for better results instead of regenerating.

## AI Generation Questions

### Which AI model should I use?

**Quick Guide:**
- **Fast, general content:** Together AI
- **Complex analysis or multimodal:** Google Gemini
- **Premium quality:** OpenAI
- **Images (artistic):** Together AI
- **Images (realistic):** OpenAI
- **Text-to-speech:** OpenAI (only option)
- **Speech-to-text:** OpenAI or Google Gemini
- **Video analysis:** Google Gemini (only option)

See our [AI Features Guide](./AI_FEATURES.md) for detailed comparisons.

### Why is my generation taking so long?

**Possible reasons:**
- Long or complex prompts require more processing
- High platform traffic (try again in a few minutes)
- Large file uploads (images, videos) take longer
- Video analysis can take 1-5 minutes
- Network connection issues

If it takes more than 2 minutes for text or 5 minutes for files, refresh and try again.

### The AI output isn't what I expected. What can I do?

**Improve results by:**
1. Being more specific in your prompt
2. Providing examples of what you want
3. Specifying tone, style, and length
4. Using prompt enhancement feature
5. Trying a different AI model
6. Using chatbot mode to refine iteratively

See [Prompt Writing Best Practices](./AI_FEATURES.md#prompt-writing-best-practices).

### Can I edit AI-generated content?

Yes! Open any saved document and click "Edit". Modify the content as needed and save.

### How do I save my AI generations?

After generation completes:
1. Click "Save" button
2. Give it a descriptive title
3. Choose a folder (or create new one)
4. Add tags (optional)
5. Click "Save"

### Can I regenerate content?

Yes, click "Regenerate" to create a new version. Note: This consumes additional tokens.

### Can the AI remember previous conversations?

Yes, if you enable "Chatbot Mode" before generating. The AI maintains conversation context within that chat session.

### What's the maximum length for prompts?

- Text prompts: 4,096 characters
- Image generation prompts: 1,000 characters
- File descriptions: 500 characters

### What file types can I upload?

**Images:** JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, HEIF, GIF
**Audio:** MP3, WAV, AIFF, AAC, OGG, FLAC
**Video:** MP4, MPEG, MOV, AVI, FLV, MPG, WebM, WMV, 3GPP
**Documents:** PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD

Maximum file size: 250 MB

### Can I generate NSFW or inappropriate content?

No. Our AI models have content filters that block:
- Adult/NSFW content
- Violence or gore
- Hate speech
- Illegal activities
- Harassment

Violation may result in account suspension.

### Why was my generation blocked?

The AI's content filters detected potentially inappropriate content in your prompt or the attempted output. Modify your prompt and try again.

### Can I use generated content commercially?

Yes! You own the content you create with MultinotesAI. Use it for:
- Business purposes
- Client projects
- Publications
- Products
- Marketing
