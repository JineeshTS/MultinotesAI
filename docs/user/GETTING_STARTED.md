## Understanding Tokens

Tokens are the currency of MultinotesAI. They measure how much AI processing you use.

### What Are Tokens?

- **Tokens** are units that represent text processed by AI models
- One token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words
- Both your **input** (prompt) and **output** (generated content) use tokens

### Token Types

MultinotesAI uses two types of tokens:

#### 1. Text Tokens
- Used for text-to-text generation
- Used for code generation
- Used for basic AI interactions
- Most common token type

#### 2. File Tokens
- Used for processing images
- Used for audio/speech operations
- Used for video analysis
- Generally cost more than text tokens

### How Tokens Are Used

| Operation | Approximate Token Cost |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Simple question (100 words) | ~130 tokens |
| Short article (500 words) | ~650 tokens |
| Long article (2000 words) | ~2600 tokens |
| Image generation | 500-1000 file tokens |
| Image analysis | 200-500 file tokens |
| Speech-to-text (1 minute) | 300-600 file tokens |
| Video analysis (short) | 1000-2000 file tokens |

### Checking Your Token Balance

[Screenshot: Token balance display]

1. Look at the top right of your dashboard
2. Click on your token balance to see:
   - **Available tokens** - What you can use now
   - **Used tokens** - What you've consumed
   - **Expired tokens** - Tokens that weren't used in time
   - **Token history** - Recent usage log

### Token Conservation Tips

1. **Be concise with prompts** - Clear but brief prompts save tokens
2. **Use appropriate models** - Some models are more efficient
3. **Review before regenerating** - Edit prompts instead of starting over
4. **Set reasonable limits** - For images, you don't always need 4K resolution

Always save content you like. You can't retrieve unsaved AI generations.
