Living sustainably in a bustling city might seem like trying to grow a
garden in a concrete jungle—challenging, but not impossible! If you're a
city dweller who's passionate about reducing your environmental footprint,
you've probably wondered how to make meaningful changes when your lifestyle
revolves around high-rises, public transportation, and limited green space.
The good news? You don't need a backyard or a countryside cottage to embrace
eco-friendly living...
```

**Structure your prompt like this:**
- **Subject:** What is the main focus?
- **Setting:** Where is it located?
- **Lighting:** What's the light like?
- **Style:** What artistic style?
- **Mood:** What feeling should it convey?

#### 2. Specify Artistic Style

Include style references:
- "in the style of Van Gogh"
- "photorealistic"
- "watercolor painting"
- "digital art"
- "3D render"
- "pixel art"
- "manga style"

#### 3. Control Composition

Use composition terms:
- "close-up shot"
- "wide angle view"
- "bird's eye view"
- "centered composition"
- "rule of thirds"

#### 4. Define Quality and Detail

Add quality descriptors:
- "highly detailed"
- "8K resolution"
- "professional photography"
- "award-winning"
- "intricate details"

### Common Image Generation Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Image too generic | Add more specific details to your prompt |
| Wrong style | Explicitly mention the desired art style |
| Poor composition | Use composition terms like "centered" or "wide shot" |
| Unwanted elements | Use negative prompts: "without text" or "no watermarks" |

### The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

#### 1. Be Specific and Clear

❌ **Bad:** "Write about marketing"

✅ **Good:** "Write a 500-word blog post about email marketing best practices for e-commerce businesses, focusing on welcome series and abandoned cart campaigns"

#### 2. Provide Context

❌ **Bad:** "Explain this concept"

✅ **Good:** "Explain blockchain technology to a 10-year-old child using simple analogies and avoiding technical jargon"

#### 3. Specify Format and Structure

❌ **Bad:** "Give me SEO tips"

✅ **Good:** "Create a numbered list of 10 SEO tips for small business websites, with each tip including a brief explanation and an actionable example"

❌ **Bad:** "Write a product description"

✅ **Good:** "Write a compelling product description for organic coffee beans in an enthusiastic, conversational tone that appeals to health-conscious millennials"

#### 5. Include Examples (Few-Shot Learning)

```
Prompt: "Convert product names to URL slugs following these examples:

Example 1:
Input: 'Premium Leather Wallet - Brown'
Output: 'premium-leather-wallet-brown'

Example 2:
Input: 'Men's Running Shoes (Size 10)'
Output: 'mens-running-shoes-size-10'

Now convert: 'Stainless Steel Water Bottle - 750ml'"
```

### Prompt Templates

#### Template 1: Content Creation
```

```

### Advanced Prompt Techniques

#### Chain of Thought Prompting
Encourage step-by-step reasoning:

```
Prompt: "Solve this problem step by step, showing your reasoning at each stage:

A store offers a 20% discount on all items. After the discount, there's an
additional 10% off for members. What is the final price of an item originally
priced at $100?

Let's think through this carefully:"
```

#### Role-Based Prompting
Assign the AI a specific role:

```
Prompt: "You are an experienced financial advisor. A client asks: 'Should I
pay off my student loans or invest in index funds?' Provide a balanced,
professional response considering both options."
```

#### Iterative Refinement
Start broad, then narrow down:

```
First Prompt: "Brainstorm 10 blog post ideas about productivity"
Second Prompt: "Expand on idea #3 with an outline"
Third Prompt: "Write the introduction for this blog post"
```

### Common Prompt Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Too vague** | AI makes assumptions | Add specific details |
